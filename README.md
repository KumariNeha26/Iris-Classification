Iris Classification - Machine Learning Model

Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal dimensions. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization to achieve high classification accuracy.

Key Steps
Data Processing: Load, clean, and preprocess the Iris dataset.
Exploratory Analysis: Visualize trends and feature correlations.
Model Development: Train KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM classifiers.
Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimization: Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

Outcome
The project delivers a robust classification model with optimized performance, demonstrating effective feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
