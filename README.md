# Iris-Classification
The Iris Classification project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica species using features like petal and sepal length and width. The project will explore the Iris dataset, apply classification algorithms, and evaluate their performance for accurate predictions.
