# Iris-Classification
The Iris Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica—using features like petal and sepal length and width. This project will explore the Iris dataset, apply various classification algorithms, and evaluate their performance for accurate predictions.

Project Steps
Understand the Problem: Classify iris flowers based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Dataset Preparation: Use the Iris dataset with features and labels.
Data Exploration & Visualization: Analyze data with statistics and visualizations.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize, and split data.
Model Selection & Training: Choose and train algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize using Grid or Random Search.
Model Interpretation: Analyze important features and visualize decision boundaries.
